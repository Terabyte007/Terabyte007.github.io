session admitted not same as the session_id in transaction
how do we get the session admitted for freshers? the current session should be session_admitted

session admitted = session inputted if level is in (100, 200_DE, 300_DE)
for tbl_students_master_test, check if the matric number exist, if it does, don't update, if it does not, insert records (done)

I want it to just ignore duplicate entries for the key and not log it in the csv file (done)

If it is a case of duplicate entry for key in insertion to tbl_students_transactions_test, no need to log it in the excel file, it should just ignore (done)

It should insert distinct records into the tbl_course_registered_test table with columns:

id	student_id_fk	student_dept_id_fk	course_id_fk	course_dept_id_fk	course_faculty_id_fk	course_code	course_units	level_id_fk	semester_id_fk	status	date_registered	session_id_fk	session	ca	exam	result	old_result	new_result	ca_remark	exam_remark	result_remark	grade_id_fk	gp7	gp5	gp4	semester	last_update_batch	is_approved	is_unreg	key	is_new	blank_first_semester


It should check the tbl_course_registered_test table to see if the column named 'key' exists (this will be in the form key = CONCAT(student_id_fk,':',course_id_fk,':',session_id_fk)), if it does, it should not modify the records but if it does not, it should insert the records to the tbl_course_registered_test table.

this block inserts into the tbl_course_registered_test table but there are issues where the course_department are blanks in the students_courses table. I want to make a modification to this block while maintating other aspects pf this block cos they are working fine. Modifications are:

1. course_dept_id_fk = (join students_courses with tbl_courses on students_courses.course_code = tbl_courses.code and set course_dept_id_fk = tbl_courses.dept_id_fk), 
2. course_faculty_id_fk = (join students_courses with tbl_departments on students_courses.course_department = tbl_departments.title and set course_faculty_id_fk = tbl_departments.faculty_id_fk), for where the students_courses.course_department has no value, use the tbl_course_registered_test.course_dept_id_fk to find the faculty_id in tbl_departments with both tables having tbl_course_registered_test.course_dept_id_fk = tbl_departments.id for joins 

3. where there are no 0 values for units, it should look into the tbl_courses table using students_courses.course_code = tbl_courses.code and use the tbl_courses.unit there and no need to log it in the csv if done.

4. For a case of duplicate records, eg, cases similar to 'IntegrityError: (1062, "Duplicate entry '27:1297:16' for key 'key'")', just ignore it and do not log it in the csv file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for cases where the student has blank or incorrect values for faculty in the excel file, use the Student Department to get the faculty by joining the students_courses table with tbl departments on students_courses.Student_department = tbl_departments.id and fill the student_faculty
